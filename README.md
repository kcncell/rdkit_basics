# rdkit_basics
This Jupyter notebook is meant to serve as an introduction to rdkit. This will help you to work on few basic projects  related to chemical structures and data. Understanding chemical data in computer language is one of the critical aspects of the deep learning in chemical and biological science. I will be adding more smaller notebooks that are essential for any deep learning projects.
